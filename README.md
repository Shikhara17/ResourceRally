# Resource Rally

## Introduction
**Resource Rally** is an advanced resource management system designed to automate the collection and deposition of resources in a game environment. It leverages the efficiency of the A* algorithm for pathfinding and task execution, integrated within the SEPIA framework.

## Features
- **Automated Resource Management**: Automatically handles the collection and deposition of resources using multiple agents.
- **Efficient Pathfinding**: Utilizes the A* algorithm to calculate the most efficient routes for resource collection and deposition.
- **Task Execution**: Seamlessly manages tasks within the game environment, ensuring optimal resource handling.

## Tech Stack
- **Java**: Primary programming language for system development.
- **SEPIA**: Used as the simulation environment for the agents.
- **A***: Algorithm for pathfinding to ensure efficient navigation.
- **Strips Action**: Utilized for planning actions in the environment.
- **HashMaps and Stacks**: Employed for managing collections of data and tasks within the application.
